# odin-recipes

This is the first project using HTML foundations.

I built a simple recipe's website.

Elements that I've used in this project are:
    <h1></h1> - Header 1 for the recipe's name
    <h3></h3> - Header 3 for the "Description", "Ingredients", and "Steps" title
    <p></p> - paragraph for the description
    <a href=""></a> - links to each recipe's
    <img src="" > - for the image of the recipe's
    <ul></ul> - Unordered list for the list of ingradients
    <ol><ol> - Oredered list for the steps
